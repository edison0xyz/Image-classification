DISCLAIMER:
I only performed evaluation on the train dataset because i ran into a problem while processing the test dataset. I initially moved on to do CNN, thinking i will come back and work on it again. Turns out that since CNN has a significantly better score, there is no point wasting time to make the test dataset work. 

I believe the 80/20 train-test split is a good enough measure for the analysis.
